## Overview
This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that collects weather data from an external API, stores it in a SQLite database, and visualizes it using Python libraries.

The pipeline collects weather parameters like temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind data from multiple cities, and stores them for historical analysis and visualization.
